<p><br><br>Hi. Full disclosure; I literally forgot I made a blog? I got so tied up in life unfolding [in a good way] that I forgot I laid the foundation for something so cool and relatively ancient-feeling.<br></p>
<p>But anyways, I'm here now. So let's catch up, shall we?<br></p>
<p><br>Since I created the blog back in December, I feel like my life has been cascading in the best way possible. I'm well into my weight loss journey, with more ground to go but tons of energy suddenly!
    <br><br>I wake up with the sun without even trying. I meditate and walk and read philosophy books for fun instead of trying to get somewhere. I feel like I'm living the yoga mom dream but without the wine-o addiction part.
    <br><br>Lowkey, this particular blog post will be mostly text, as I'm warming myself back up to a project I lowkey forgot about.<br></p>
<h3 class="subtitle">What's your deal?</h3>
<p>My deal, dear reader, is that I'm feeling freer than ever. Part of that is because of concrete things I've done that make my life materially less friction-filled. But moreso, it's a deep divestment from my preferences as a guiding anchor of how I approach situations.
    <br><br>Because when I approach something, the first question I ask is not "Do I/Do I Not like this thing?", I'm open to see it as it comes rather than what I want out of it or project onto it. Surprisingly, this results in a much more pleasant experience not because I have no standards, just because I don't have expections that will inevitably be dashed. The funny thing about it is that, while that being an actually mature orientation, opens up life to be the play it was meant to be, not the kind that makes you flip the boardgame table of the family Monopoly game, but honest to goodness PLAY.</p>
<h3 class="subtitle">Stop Pontificating you joyous freak.</h3>
<p>Ok yeah thanks me for judging me I guess. I feel like I finally have the space to look at stuff that has dogged me for a long time with compassion instead of angst and judgement and finally set down stupid garbage I've kept in my backpack. Bcuz I really needed to hold onto empty crystal pepsi cans and pencil erasers warn to a nub. You never know when you'll need completely useless shit.
    <br><br>It's cool! What can you drop that you don't need anymore, and maybe forgot you were holding onto?</p>
<h3 class="subtitle">So You're Renouncing Your Past?</h3>
<p>Nope! I actually recently brought back to life my 2014 short film "Robot Jones" whose name was lifted from a 2000s cartoon. I moved the raw footage from an ancient 4TB HDD to a much more modern SATA SSD, to ensure the film that has never been screened stays alive for another generation. Maybe one day you'll get to see it! Who knows. That film is, as all my stories are, allegorical of myself. It's about a middle school boy who learns that he's an android. A coming of age story complete with parents who tighten your loose bolts, even when you'd rather they don't.
    <br><br>It's cool to bring it back up and reminisce over its creation. Been so long yaknow? The distance between the characters and me when filming it is the same as me now to me then, I think. Wild, huh?<br></p>
<h3 class="subtitle">Wrapping it Up</h3>
<p>
    <br>I want to keep this one short and sweet, because I'd like to post on this blog more often, not as like a repository of amazing insights, but just..... a diary I don't mind people seeing? Like a way to reflect on myself without getting TOOO deep. Don't wanna drown any readers here. If you're reading this, presumably I trust you to read this. That or you're a Russian bot...... To be seen!
    <br><br>I make no promises of a consistent schedule but I'd like to aim for maybe one post a month? Though, making such statements is actually a great way to then NOT do it. So fuck you; no guarentees.
    <br>How about you? Anything you're reflecting on in your life now? Or are you just trying to get through this week. That's cool too, just don't do that TOO long or "this week" will turn into last decade in a second.
    <br><br><br>TTFN losers! I'm riding off into the sunset of infinite Summer.</p>
