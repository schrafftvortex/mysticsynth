<p><br><br>Hello! <br><br> I'm back again with another text-based blog post! And less than a month after the last one, aren't you lucky?<br></p>
<p>I'm feeling called to write this, for whatever that's worth. I was playing a casual indie game "Hauntii" and got a gentle tug in my mind of "I'd like to write a blog post." so here we are!<br></p>
<p><br>I'm reconfiguring some stuff in my life and it feels a bit like a culmination of the past several years, but also pretty casual.
    <br><br>I'll start with the most recent one. Today I cleared out my room a ton - removing the second bed and turning that space into a casual sitting area for meditation, journaling, etc.
    <br><br>I also added an analog clock! I wonder if kids today even really know how to read those. I can see it from any of the three areas of my room [bed, computer desk, casual sitting area] and I hope its gentle non-ticking nature helps me have a natural easy relationship with time.<br></p>
<h3 class="subtitle">Why are you writing this again?</h3>
<p>Well OK if you insist I will tell you. Twelve years ago yesterday I had an NDE. [Look it up if you don't know..]
    <br><br>It's not that scary to me now, but it did change my perspective on life in a way that was difficult for an 18 year old kid to process, so I simply took 12 years to process it. Luckily, I lately feel pretty settled in what it showed me. If you care to know more and are a trusted friend, feel free to ask me for a few deets.</p>
<h3 class="subtitle">Oh man, are you ok?</h3>
<p>I would say yes! I'm taking this inflection point as an opportunity to reassess what does and does not serve me in life, and try to live more in line with what helps me flourish. Proper sleep hygene, meditation, just enjoying the contentment of daily living as it arrives? It's all really good stuff!
    <br><br>I'm realizing I may have an opportunity to have a yet richer life than previously, which is incredible! [I might even start biking or swimming ;]</p>
<h3 class="subtitle">So You're on a Health Kick?</h3>
<p>My friends, I am on a LIVING kick. Not that I wasn't living for the past 30+ years but that I am now recommiting myself to what does make me FEEL alive and steady at the same time in a non thrill-seeking way. I've had enough addrenaline spikes for one lifetime.</p>
<h3 class="subtitle">Intentions for This Blog & Journaling Efforts</h3>
<p>
    <br>In addition to this blog I am taking up journaling; in the format of a physical journal, typed entries, and voice recordings. I'm hoping to coalate them and date them on my local machine so that I can easily reference them later.
    <br><br>It's exciting, having a place to reflect that's JUST for me as well as this blog, which is more public facing! I didn't think about how nice it would be to get the itch to blog and simply to just be able to? It's really enjoyable. I'm just happy to enter a situation where I'm willing and able to do both the blog and the journaling and whatever else!
    <br>Thanks for reading all this!~ It does mean a lot that you clicked through this link and kept up with my goings on! Hope all's well with you [unless you're a bot scraping my website].
    <br><br>As a heads up, in August, I will most likely be doing a Boku No Natsuyasumi playthrough on my YouTube, corresponding which each day in the game [which takes place in August 1975, 50 YEARS AGO]. The game meant a lot to me last year and most likely returning will be a blast. Should I choose to, I'll link to the first one here once it's up and you can follow along from there!
    <br><br><br>As always, thanks for reading a classic style blog and I hope this post finds you well. I guess at the minimum it DID find you. Bye!</p>
